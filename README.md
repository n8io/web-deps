# web-deps
A prototype for a responsive web app that visualizes service dependencies

## Setup / External dependencies

1. Node.Js, preferrable version 5.1+
1. Login credentials to administer questions.
1. An `.env` file containing environment config values. See [.env.example](.env.example) for the required key/value pairs.

## Getting started

1. `npm install --production`
1. `npm run start`
1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## What you get

1. ExpressJs framework
1. Material design UI with AngularJs
1. Minor CSRF precautions
1. Gulp build process
1. ESLint and Stylint - linting
1. Git hooks for linting checks
1. Optional CircleCI integration
1. Optional Dockerfile generation

## What you don't get

The following items were left out due to the nature of this prototype. However all would normally be part of the development lifecycle.

1. Unit tests. The build process for tests is in place but I chose to forgo TDD for two reasons:
  1. In the interest of time vs long term gain
  1. Rapid prototyping in general is not tested
1. Code coverage (see above)
1. A Content security policy ([see helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet))
1. Trust issues. Behind the walls of an auth'd user, I assume the user is a "good web citizen"
1. Cross browser testing. Dev tested on Chrome, briefly checked on Firefox.
1. Windows install and support. This was developed on a Mac.
